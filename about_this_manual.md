# About this Manual {#about-this-manual}

This manual gives you a step by step overview of how to set up an Ushahidi version 3.0 deployment, and how to make full use of [the features the platform offers](https://www.ushahidi.com/features). You can:-

*   download the software at no cost and host it on your own servers from [https://github.com/ushahidi/platform](https://github.com/ushahidi/platform).
*   sign up for a deployment on http://ushahidi.com. There are currently three different plans available for you to choose from, which you can review on [our plans page here](https://www.ushahidi.com/plans).

For groups running social impact projects unable to afford the current pricing model, you can apply for a [free responder plan here](https://www.ushahidi.com/plans/apply-for-free).

This manual will show you how to install the Ushahidi platform, or sign up for an ushahidi account, customise it to meet the needs of your project, manage people and incoming data, as well as visualise and analyse your data. It is meant to be a comprehensive learning guide for brand new users of the platform, as well as a reference point for those who may have some prior experience using the platform.
