* [Install the software](1.-installing-ushahidi.md) in your own servers.
* sign up for a deployment on [http://ushahidi.com](http://ushahidi.com). There are currently three different plans available for you to choose from, which you can review on [our plans page here](https://www.ushahidi.com/pricing).

For groups running social impact projects unable to afford the current pricing model, you can apply for a [free plan here](https://www.ushahidi.com/pricing/apply-for-free).
