# 6.6 Deleting Posts

The ability to delete posts is only available to admins or registered users with adequate permissions. This means that non registered users cannot delete posts.

To delete

* An individual post from the data view, click on the three dotted icon from the list of detail pane as shown below, then click on _**Delete**_![](../.gitbook/assets/three_dots_map_mode.png)![](../.gitbook/assets/delete_individual.png)
