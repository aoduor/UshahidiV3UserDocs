## 5.1 Viewing Posts {#5-1-viewing-posts}

Posts on your deployment can be categorised into two types of data:-

*   **_Structured_:** Incoming posts from the web platform and smartphone applications are classified as structured posts, since they adhere to the structure of surveys created on your deployment.
*   **_Unknown_:** Incoming messages from SMS, Twitter and Email are classified as unknown posts, since they do not adhere to the structure of surveys created on your deployment. This means that these messages come in their raw form, and have to be manually structured by admins/anyone with permissions to edit posts, to fit into the structure of your survey. E.g an SMS message “Hello, my name is Angela” will need to be broken down into a title, a description, properly categorised etc.

By default, every deployment has a set of three featured Saved Searches(read more in [section 7.2](../7_analysing_data_on_your_deployment/72_saved_searches.md) of this manual) from which you can view posts on your deployment, on the top menu bar.

These include:-**_All posts_**: Lists all posts(structured and unstructured) that have come into your deployment

*   **_Published Posts_**: Lists all posts that have been made public on your deployment(i.e can be viewed by registered/non registered users on your deployment.
*   **_Unknown Posts_**: Lists all messages received from SMS, Email and Twitter
*   **_My posts_**: Lists all posts created by you as a user

From this post list page, you should be able to see the following:-

*   A menu bar on the left with different survey types to filter the list from.
*   **Post visibility Status:** You can tell if a post is public or only visible to a specific audience
*   **Post source** (is it from the Web, SMS, Email or Twitter?).
    *   **_Structured posts_** via web/smartphones will have their respective source label on them.
    *   **_Unstructured posts_** will have a label denoting their source, as seen below with this sample SMS message
