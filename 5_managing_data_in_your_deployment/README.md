# 5\. Managing Data in your deployment {#5-managing-data-in-your-deployment}

A post is a report of a single instance of something in the deployment. It can be made up of many fields, such as Title, Description, Date, Links, and/or location. Ushahidi allows for collection of posts via

*   **_SMS_**: These can be configured to come in via SMSSync, FrontlineSMS, Nexmo and Twilio.
*   **_Twitter_**: You can pull our tweets based on specific hashtags, search terms, and/or directly from specific accounts.
*   **_Email_**: You can configure your deployment to receive post from an email address

**_NB: You can configure SMS, Twitter and Email as data sources as described in_ **[**_Section 3.4_**](../3_configuring_your_deployment/34_data_sources.md)** _of this manual_**

*   **_Web(your deployment page online)_**: Since Ushahidi is responsive, you can add a post from the web app from any device that can access the internet (a computer, tablet, or mobile phone).
*   **_Smartphone apps_**: Our native applications on Android and iOS are still a work in progress at the moment.

This chapter will describe how to manage data coming in from these different sources
