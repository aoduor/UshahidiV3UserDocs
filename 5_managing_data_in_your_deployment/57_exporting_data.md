## 5.7 Exporting Data {#5-7-exporting-data}

The platform now allows for data export, enabling you to download posts from the platform in CSV format. You can download posts from your map mode, Data mode, [saved searches](../7_analysing_data_on_your_deployment/72_saved_searches.md) and [collections](../7_analysing_data_on_your_deployment/73_collections.md) you have access to, or based on custom criteria( [search filters](../7_analysing_data_on_your_deployment/71_filters.md) set by you as a user).

To export a CSV file,

*   Click on saved search/collection youâ€™d like to export data from.
    *   You can also use the Search section on your header to filter posts you would like to export based on specific criteria
*   Once done, click on the **Share** button on the right hand of your header menu

Then click on Export to CSV as shown below:

*   A small confirmation box will appear seeking confirmation on whether you would like to proceed with exporting your data.
    *   Click on **_OK_** to export your CSV file
    *   Click on **_Cancel_** if you would like to terminate the export process
