## 5.6 Importing Data {#5-6-importing-data}

The **_Data Import_** feature allows you to import posts into the platform. It is particularly useful in cases where:-

*   You need to upload posts in bulk
*   You need to upload posts that people can’t send to you via email/phone but have the data available in CSV format
*   (In future) You are transferring data from one platform to another

To import a CSV File,

*   On the left hand menu bar, click on **_Settings_**

*   Then, click on **_Data Import_**
*   You’ll get redirected to the import page, as shown below.

*   Select a survey you’d like to match the data you’re uploading to. This field is populated with a list of all existing surveys on your deployment.

    *   You are uploading a file in CSV format. Any other file formats are not accepted
    *   Your CSV file size does not exceed 2MB
