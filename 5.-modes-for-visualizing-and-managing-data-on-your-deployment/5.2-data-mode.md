# 5.2 Data Mode

This mode allows you to view, triage, and manage posts coming into your deployment as a chronological list of events over time. It provides a split pane that allows for viewing post summaries on the left pane, and post details and editing in the right.![](../.gitbook/assets/date_mode_before_post_selection.png)![](../.gitbook/assets/post_selected_for_viewing.png)
