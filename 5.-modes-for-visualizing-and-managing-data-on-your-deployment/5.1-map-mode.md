# 5.1 Map Mode

This mode displays all published posts on a map.

* Each post appears as an icon on the map. In the event that you opted to combine nearby posts on your Map settings page \([Section 3.2](../3.-configuring-your-deployment/3.2-general-settings.md) of this manual\), posts adjacent to each other on the map will cluster together, displaying a number denoting number of posts combined.
* Clicking on each individual post displays a small pop up box with the _**post title**_ and _**description.**_
* You should also be able to zoom in and out of the map as desired.

See below for an example from the Uchaguzi deployment![](../.gitbook/assets/map_mode.jpg)

You also get a breakdown of incoming posts by source, as shown below.![](../.gitbook/assets/posts_by_source.png)  
Visitors to your ushahidi instance can also select the language they'd like to interact with your data in. The language list consists of languages that have been translated upto 80%.
