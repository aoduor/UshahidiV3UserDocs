## 6.4 Editing Posts {#5-3-editing-posts}

The post editing function is only available to admins or registered users with adequate permissions. This means that non registered users cannot edit posts.

This feature is particularly useful when creating posts out of _**unstructured posts**_** **\(messages from SMS, Email, Twitter\)

To edit a post,

* Click on _**Edit**_ from:-

  * The Posts List page
  * An individual post’s view page

* This will take you to the post creation page, where you’ll be able to edit any of the content.

* If you’ve got an image uploaded you can replace the image

* When done making changes, click on _**Save**_.

If you’re an admin, you should be able to:

* ○ Set the status of this post to Published \(Which makes it public\), Under Review or Archived. When done making changes, click on _Save_.
* Change the post date

### 6.4.1 Structuring posts

### 6.4.2 Locked posts

Data processing and analysis should be collaborative. When you start editing a Post, it will be locked and other users cannot edit, update, or accidentally interfere with your work. When you finish working and save or close the post, it is automatically unlocked again. Conversely, if you need to edit a Post that is currently locked you will be able to quickly find out which of your colleagues is working on it and coordinate changes with them.

To avoid issues with Posts remaining locked, we have introduced a set of safeguards to ensure that the Posts will always return to an unlocked state.

* Locks expire after 5 minutes, to avoid locking a post when someone is not actively working on it.

* When a user logs out, all of their locked posts will be unlocked.

* Administrators have the right to “break” a lock to ensure that a Post becomes available again in a time sensitive situation.

* Even when locked for edit, all users who have permission are able to view and review the Post.
