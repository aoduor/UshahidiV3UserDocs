To edit a post,

* Click on _**Edit**_ from:-

  * The Posts List page
  * An individual post’s view page

* This will take you to the post creation page, where you’ll be able to edit any of the content.

* If you’ve got an image uploaded you can replace the image

* When done making changes, click on _**Save**_.

If you’re an admin, you should be able to:

* ○ Set the status of this post to Published \(Which makes it public\), Under Review or Archived. When done making changes, click on _Save_.
