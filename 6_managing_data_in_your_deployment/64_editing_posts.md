## 6.4 Editing Posts {#5-3-editing-posts}

The post editing function is only available to admins or registered users with adequate permissions. This means that non registered users cannot edit posts.

This feature is particularly useful when creating posts out of _**unstructured posts**_** **\(messages from SMS, Email, Twitter\). We'll cover   the structuring process in [section 6.4.1 below.](#641-structuring-posts)

To edit a post,

* Select a post from your data view![](/assets/Date_mode_before_post_selection.png)![](/assets/Post_selected_for_viewing.png)

* Click on _**Edit. **_This will load the post editor on the right pane of your page, where you’ll be able to edit any of the content.![](/assets/Edit_button.png)![](/assets/Edit_a_post.png)![](/assets/Edit_your_task.png)

* If you're logged in and have adequate permissions you should also be able to change the status of your post.![](/assets/Set_edit_post_status.png)

* When done making changes, click on _**Save**_.

### 6.4.1 Structuring posts

### 6.4.2 Locked posts

Data processing and analysis should be collaborative. When you start editing a Post, it will be locked and other users cannot edit, update, or accidentally interfere with your work. When you finish working and save or close the post, it is automatically unlocked again. Conversely, if you need to edit a Post that is currently locked you will be able to quickly find out which of your colleagues is working on it and coordinate changes with them.

To avoid issues with Posts remaining locked, we have introduced a set of safeguards to ensure that the Posts will always return to an unlocked state.

* Locks expire after 5 minutes, to avoid locking a post when someone is not actively working on it.

* When a user logs out, all of their locked posts will be unlocked.

* Administrators have the right to “break” a lock to ensure that a Post becomes available again in a time sensitive situation.

* Even when locked for edit, all users who have permission are able to view and review the Post.
