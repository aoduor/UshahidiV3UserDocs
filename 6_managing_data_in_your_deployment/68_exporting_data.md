## 6.7 Exporting Data {#5-7-exporting-data}

The platform now allows for data export, enabling you to download posts from the platform in CSV format. You can download posts from your map mode, Data mode, [saved searches](../7_analysing_data_on_your_deployment/72_saved_searches.md) and [collections](../7_analysing_data_on_your_deployment/73_collections.md) you have access to, or based on custom criteria\( [search filters](/6_managing_data_in_your_deployment/62_filters.md) set by you as a user\).

To export a CSV file,

* Click on saved search/collection youâ€™d like to export data from.
  * You can also use the Search section on your header to filter posts you would like to export based on specific criteria
* Once done, click on the **Share** button on the right hand of your header menu![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/LNQtuzf-gwuQOZQEIMe9fR5P6m6mM1SQaftlXfvcwyrDT8SBPomqSJG35mgTXSQlzTzi9lB8h4_npxRXwkt2xqNC3828jnMguW4-sOQOcvBD2mPuARRKCuCLKTEu5edlOKp2362D)
