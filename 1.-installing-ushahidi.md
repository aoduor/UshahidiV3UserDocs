# 1. Installing Ushahidi Platform

In order to start using the Ushahidi Platform you may choose between:

* Installing it yourself. This assumes that you have a suitable server or networked computer and some time to go through our published instructions. Some technical familiarity with your computing environment is needed.
* Creating your deployment online. This is done on Ushahidi's hosting service, which you may find at [https://ushahidi.io/create](https://ushahidi.io/create) . This doesn't require technical knowledge on your side.

## Installing it yourself

The latest documentation for installing Ushahidi Platform is maintained by our developer community in the developer documentation area.

As a general guidance to which document you should start with:

1. [Bundled release](https://docs.ushahidi.com/platform-developer-documentation/development-and-code/setup_alternatives/platform_release_install). The easiest start is usually with our bundled download, which contain stable and pre-built code to save you time. Please read [this document](https://docs.ushahidi.com/platform-developer-documentation/development-and-code/setup_alternatives/platform_release_install) for all the details.
2. [Developer setup](https://docs.ushahidi.com/platform-developer-documentation/development-and-code/setup_alternatives). If you may be interested in tweaking the code and willing to spend a bit more time, please head over to our list of setup guides to pick the one that suits you best.
