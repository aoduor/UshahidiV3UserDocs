# 3.4 Data Sources

There are many ways to enter posts into your Ushahidi deployment other than from the deployment itself. This section shows you how to configure all the possible data source types.

_**NB: If you’re a user on ushahidi.com, the number of data source types available to you may be limited, based on the Ushahidi plan you are subscribed to. You may review these from**_ ****[_**our plans page**_](https://www.ushahidi.com/pricing)_**. For open source/self hosted deployments, all data source types are available to you**_

To access the data sources configuration page,

* On the left hand menu bar, click on _**Settings**_

![](../.gitbook/assets/click_on_settings.png)

* Then, click on _**Data Sources**_.

![Data sources link in the deployment&apos;s settings page.](../.gitbook/assets/updated_data_sources.png)

* You should get a full list of data sources as shown below

## 3.4.1 Email <a id="3-4-1-email"></a>

This section allows you to set up the platform to receive emails from user. Before getting started, make sure that you have an email account set up on Gmail, Yahoo or any other service provider. Make sure that you have IMAP/POP enabled \(For more information on these two protocols, [visit this website](http://www.pop2imap.com/). Instructions on how to enable the IMAP/POP settings in your email can be found here

* Follow this guide to enable IMAP from external clients with [Gmail](https://support.google.com/mail/troubleshooter/1668960?hl=en). Keep in mind:
  * There are a few settings you need to configure so that Ushahidi can pull from a gmail account.
  * In gmail Settings, under "Forwarding and POP/IMAP" you need to make sure IMAP is enabled.
  * Then if you go to [https://myaccount.google.com/lesssecureapps](https://myaccount.google.com/lesssecureapps) you need turn on access for less secure apps. \(Google's docs here: [https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6010255?hl=en](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6010255?hl=en)\)  
* [Yahoo](https://help.yahoo.com/kb/SLN3697.html)

To get started with email set up,

* Click on _**the drop down icon on the right as shown**_

![](../.gitbook/assets/email.png)

* Input the following email account settings:-

  * _**Incoming server type**_: You have two options to select from, _**POP**_ and _**IMAP**_. We recommend using IMAP if possible because it’s the best way to make sure you can see all your mail at any time on all of your devices
  * _**Incoming server**_: Enter the address of the server where your email services are hosted. E.g _mail.yourwebsite.com_, _imap.gmail.com_ or _pop.gmail.com_
  * _**Incoming server port**_: Enter the port that your email account uses for incoming emails. This is also provided by your service provider and depends on the use of [SSL\(Secure Sockets Layer\)](https://www.digicert.com/ssl.htm)/[Transport Layer Security\(TLS\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security) or not. As a standard rule;
    * IMAP uses port 143 , but SSL/TLS encrypted IMAP uses port 993 .
    * POP uses port 110 , but SSL/TLS encrypted POP uses port 995
  * _**Incoming server security**_: You have 3 options to choose from to enhance secure connection to your email mailbox, depending on which is supported by your email service provider.
    * None
    * TLS - [Read more on Transport Layer Security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security)
    * SSL - [Read more on Secure Sockets Layer](https://www.digicert.com/ssl.htm)
  * _**Incoming user name**_: Enter the email address you want to use to receive emails e.g _**sample@youremail.com**_. We recommend setting up a separate email address for this purpose, preferably one that has lot of available space to avoid the account getting full in a short time, especially if the platform will be receiving a lot of submission via email.
  * _**Incoming password**_: Enter the password of the email account inserted above.
  * _**Outgoing server type**_: Select one of the three options presented to you:-
    * SMTP: Simple Mail Transfer Protocol \(SMTP\) is recommended for use with the ushahidi platform.
    * Sendmail
    * Native
  * _**Outgoing server**_: Enter the address of the server from which emails are sent out. This is also provided by the email service provider
  * _**Outgoing server port**_: Enter the port your email service provider uses for outgoing emails. The default port tends to be 25, but SMTP with SSL support uses port 465 or 587
  * _**Outgoing server security**_: Select one of the three options provided to you
    * None
    * SSL
    * TLS, which is recommended by the service provider for outgoing server security.
  * _**Outgoing user name**_: Enter the email address you want to use to send emails. E.g _**sample@youremail.com**_
  * _**Outgoing password**_: Enter the password of the email account inserted above.
  * _**Email sender name**_: This is what appears in the “from” field in outgoing emails.
