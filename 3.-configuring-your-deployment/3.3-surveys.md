# 3.3 Surveys

If you’re someone who uses Ushahidi v2, _**Surveys**_ ****\(previously referred to as _**post types\)**_ in v3 are what we used to refer to as custom forms. A survey defines critical aspects of a post’s structure and permissions. For example, a post’s “survey” defines which fields are available for contributors to complete, and who can see it when it’s published.

This section will show you how to create and manage surveys on your deployment.

_**NB: If you’re a user on ushahidi.com, there are limits to the the number of surveys you can create, based on the Ushahidi plan you are subscribed to. You may review these from**_ ****[_**our plans page**_](https://www.ushahidi.com/plans)_**. For open source/self hosted deployments, you can create as many surveys as desired.**_

To access the Surveys configuration page,

* On the left hand menu bar, click on _**Settings**_![](../.gitbook/assets/updated_settings.png)
* Then, click on _**Surveys**_.![](../.gitbook/assets/updated_surveys.png)

## 3.3.1 Building Surveys <a id="3-3-1-adding-surveys"></a>

By default, each deployment has a _**Basic Post**_ ****survey, which can be deleted or modified as needed. To create a new survey,

* Click on the _**yellow icon**_ as shown below![](../.gitbook/assets/click__add_survey.png)
* Fill in the required details.![](../.gitbook/assets/survey_add.png)
  * _**Survey Name:**_ ****Try being as specific as possible when creating your survey name so that users will understand what they are selecting when creating new posts

  * _**Fields + Tasks:**_ See below for details on how to add fields and tasks into your survey.
* Click on save once you're done building your survey.

NB: If you're setting up multiple surveys with similar structures, here's a neat trick for you - you can duplicate your survey from the survey list page as follows :\).![](../.gitbook/assets/dotted_survey_list%20%281%29.png)![](../.gitbook/assets/duplicate_survey.png)

### 3.3.1.2 Tasks

You can organize your survey into “Tasks”, allowing a deployment to add fields related to actions that need to be taken, like translation or verification. These groups of tasks are visible to specified users and can be marked as ‘complete.’ For example, if a particular survey requires verification upon submission, you can design a task to ensure your team knows the post needs to be verified before publishing. The task could include fields like whether the information was verified or not, who verified the information, how they verified it, and when they verified it. After verification, the task can be marked as complete and the post can either be moved to the next task if necessary, or published.

#### 3.3.1.2.1 Building Tasks

To add a new task,

* Click on Add Task on your survey creation/edit page![](../.gitbook/assets/add_task.png)
* A small pop up box will appear, prompting you to give your task a name
* If you’d like to make this task required before post submission, toggle the _**Require this task be completed before a post can be visible to the public button**_. This means that, a post will not be published until this task is marked as complete
* Click on _**Add & Close**_![Add\_Task.jpg](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/xIJ9akufvgs7LQnOYLf3lyoswMsOOdboXM8Q6TtbVP43inHHfOkJDWVSw5Ws_b4FfHk0EN7ZBn5ShmEUnD7SViUsC-JzkxRxRBgCCUkY5OqwwGP44m827BsjKDIMV9w438mCuxfz)
