## 7.3 Collections {#7-3-collections}

A “Collection” is a manually-curated grouping of posts. It is not dynamic, meaning the posts within it do not change unless a you manually update them.

You may find collections useful in grouping posts that you would like to share with external partners . For example , you may find it useful to add allposts that require escalation to a collection and then export data in that collection in a CSV file that youcan share with partners.

Please note that only registered users can create Collections. Non registered users can only view featured public collections
