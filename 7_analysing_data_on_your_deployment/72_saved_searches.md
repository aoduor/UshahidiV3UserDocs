## 7.2 Saved Searches {#7-2-saved-searches}

Saved searches are dynamic groupings of posts that match parameters chosen in filters. Saved searches are dynamic because as new posts are added that fit the search criteria, they will show in the saved search.

Saved searches are particularly useful for your working groups.You’re able to set filters for information that’s relevant to each working group.

For example:-

● It is useful for the structuring and publishing team to only see posts that are unstructured. Creating a saved search with these parameter s will be useful

● The verification team need to see posts that are tagged as unverified, so creating a saved search with these parameters will be useful.
