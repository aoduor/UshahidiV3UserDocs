* You’ll also need to configure your map settings from this page. Your map settings allow you to select the type of base map you want for your project\( the style your map will display as.![](/assets/Settings_2.png)

  * _**Default base layer**_: Currently, the platform only offers Openstreetmap as a map provider. Plans are being made to add additional map providers.You can choose between the _map_, _satellite_ and _humanitarian_ views. This will determine the style your map will display as on your homepage.

* * _**Default latitude and Default longitude**_: Dragging and dropping the blue pointer on the map automatically fills in these two fields. In the event that you have lat/lon values, you can also type them in and the pointer on the map will automatically update to match the points entered.
  * _**Default zoom level**_: Zooming in and out of the map using the small menu bar on the left top hand side of the map will automatically set a value in this field. You may also optionally set the zoom level by manually adding a figure in this field and your map will update to match.
  * _**Combine nearby posts:**_ This checkbox is checked by default, meaning that posts near each other will be bundled together and denoted as a single point on the map with a number to show how many posts they are. If you uncheck this option, each post will appear as a single point on the map.
* Click on _**Save**_ and refresh the page to ensure that your settings update.
