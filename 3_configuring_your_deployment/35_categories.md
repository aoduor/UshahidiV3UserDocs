*   You’ll be redirected to a page where you can manage categories on your deployment

### 3.5.1 Adding and Configuring Categories {#3-5-1-adding-and-configuring-categories}

Unlike Ushahidi v2.x, your deployment DOES NOT come with pre installed/set-up categories. You will need to create this on your new Ushahidi deployment. Categories are now treated as custom fields within a Survey. This gives you the flexibility to add certain categories to some surveys, but not others.

There are two ways to create new categories. First, navigate to **_Settings → Categories_**

*   Click on the **_Add Category icon as shown below_**

****

*   Add the following details
    *   **_Category Name:_ **Give your category a name that will appear on your homepage and when users are creating new posts.
    *   **_Description:_ **You can provide a brief description of what kind of information you will fall under this category
    *   **_Roles_**: You can opt to set your category as visible to specific user roles on your deployment here. This list is populated based on custom roles created. More on Roles in [section 4.1](../4_managing_people_on_your_deployment/41_roles.md) of this manual
    *   **_Child / parent settings_**: You can choose to set any category as a “child” to another, creating a hierarchy within the categories themselves, and will reflect this in their positioning on the sidebar.

You can also create categories on the fly within the survey form itself

*   Configure the following:
    *   **_Name:_ **Name or prompt for your survey field
    *   **_Show field description:_ **Turn this on if you’d like to add a short description or help text to the field
    *   **_Which labels should be available:_ **Select which categories you’d like to add to the field as options

*   Click **_Add &amp; Close_ **to save your new categories field
*   It will now appear as a custom field with the appropriate categories on your Survey form
