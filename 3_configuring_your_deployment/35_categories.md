## 3.5 Categories {#3-5-categories}

Categories are a way of grouping your posts based on their content within a Survey.

To access the Categories configuration page,

* On the left hand menu bar, click on _**Settings**_![](/assets/Click_on_settings.png)

* Then, click on _**Categories**_.![](/assets/Updated_Categories.png)

* You’ll be redirected to a page where you can manage categories on your deployment

### 3.5.1 Adding and Configuring Categories {#3-5-1-adding-and-configuring-categories}

Unlike Ushahidi v2.x, your deployment DOES NOT come with pre installed/set-up categories. You will need to create this on your new Ushahidi deployment. Categories are now treated as custom fields within a Survey. This gives you the flexibility to add certain categories to some surveys, but not others.

There are two ways to create new categories. First, navigate to _**Settings → Categories**_

* Click on the _**Add Category icon as shown below**_![](/assets/Add_category.png)

* Add the following details

  * _**Category Name:**_** **Give your category a name that will appear on your homepage and when users are creating new posts.
  * _**Description:**_** **You can provide a brief description of what kind of information you will fall under this category
  * _**Roles**_: You can opt to set your category as visible to specific user roles on your deployment here. This list is populated based on custom roles created. More on [Roles here](/4_managing_people_on_your_deployment/41_roles.md). 
  * _**Child / parent settings**_: You can choose to set any category as a “child” to another, creating a hierarchy within the categories themselves, and will reflect this in their positioning on the sidebar.![](/assets/Add_category_1.png)![](/assets/category_sidebar.png)

* Click on _**Save**_ to create the category. You can now choose to add this category to any of your Surveys.

You can also create categories on the fly within the survey form itself

* Navigate to a Survey form that already has a categories field
* Under the categories field, you will see an option to _**Add new category**_. Click this.![](/assets/category_on_the_fly.png)

* Type the name of the new category you’d like to add

* Click the yellow check mark to save your new category, or click the trash can icon to cancel the new category creation![](/assets/category_on_the_fly_1.png)

* To edit or manage your category and its settings, navigate to **Settings → Categories**

Add categories as custom fields as you build and edit Surveys. First, navigate to **Settings → Surveys,** and either select the already existing Survey you’d like to edit, or create a new Survey.

* Click on _**Add field**_ at the bottom of the survey builder and select \_**Categories **\_from the list of field options ![](/assets/Pop_up_2_cat.png)
* Configure the following:
  * _**Name:**_** **Name or prompt for your survey field
  * _**Show field description:**_** **Turn this on if you’d like to add a short description or help text to the field
  * _**Which labels should be available:**_** **Select which categories you’d like to add to the field as options

* It will now appear as a custom field with the appropriate categories on your Survey form
